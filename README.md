# Start Page
A simple home page or start page for browsers

### To set this as your start page
- Open settings in your browser(chrome) and go to the 'On Startup' area
- Select 'open a specific page or set of pages' option
- Click 'Set Page' and copy and paste this url - http://aravindballa.github.io/startpage there

This works even for other browsers as well. The procedure is similar.

If you want this even when you open a new tab, search for an extension which redirects to that url specified.
'New Tab Redirect' is the extension for chrome.
